1. Project Structure
1.1 Folder Structure
Use a modular folder structure with feature-based organization.
Group related components, services, and modules together.
Example structure:
bash
Copy code
/src
  /app
    /core
      /services
      /guards
      /interceptors
    /shared
      /components
      /pipes
      /directives
    /features
      /feature-one
        /components
        /services
        /store
      /feature-two
    /layouts
    /app.module.ts
    /app.component.ts
1.2 Naming Conventions
Components: FeatureComponent
Services: FeatureService
Modules: FeatureModule
Pipes: FeaturePipe
Directives: FeatureDirective
2. Coding Standards
2.1 TypeScript
Always use TypeScript types and interfaces for better type safety.
Prefer const over let where variables are not reassigned.
Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
Avoid any type; use more specific types.
2.2 Components
Component Decorators: Use the @Component decorator with clear metadata.
Templates: Keep templates simple and use Angular’s built-in directives.
Styles: Use component-specific styles to avoid conflicts. Prefer SCSS for styling.
2.3 Services
Singleton Services: Use services for sharing logic and data across components.
Dependency Injection: Use Angular’s DI system to inject services into components.
HTTP Requests: Use Angular’s HttpClient module. Centralize API logic in a service.
2.4 Modules
Feature Modules: Use feature modules to encapsulate related components and services.
Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for feature modules to improve initial load performance.
Shared Modules: Place reusable components, directives, and pipes in shared modules.
3. Best Practices
3.1 Component Interaction
@Input/@Output: Use @Input and @Output decorators for parent-child communication.
Service-Based Communication: Use services for communication between sibling components or different modules.
3.2 Forms
Reactive Forms: Prefer reactive forms for complex form logic.
Validation: Use Angular’s built-in validators and create custom validators as needed.
3.3 Routing
Routes: Define routes in a dedicated routing module. Use lazy loading for feature modules.
Guards: Use route guards to handle authentication and authorization.
3.4 State Management
Service-Based State: Use services for simple state management.
NgRx: Consider NgRx or similar libraries for more complex state management scenarios.
4. Performance
4.1 Change Detection
OnPush Strategy: Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush where possible to optimize performance.
TrackBy: Use trackBy in *ngFor loops to improve rendering performance.
4.2 Lazy Loading
Implement lazy loading for feature modules to decrease initial load time.
4.3 AOT Compilation
Enable Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation in production builds for faster rendering.
5. Testing
5.1 Unit Testing
Use Jasmine and Karma for unit testing.
Write tests for components, services, and other critical code.
5.2 End-to-End Testing
Use Protractor or Cypress for end-to-end testing.
Write tests to cover critical user flows and interactions.
6. Documentation
6.1 Code Comments
Use comments to explain complex logic and important decisions.
Avoid redundant comments; the code should be self-explanatory.
6.2 README Files
Maintain a README file with project setup instructions, coding standards, and contribution guidelines.
7. Version Control
7.1 Commit Messages
Use clear and concise commit messages. Follow the format: type(scope): description.
Example: fix(auth): resolve token expiration issue
7.2 Branching Strategy
Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
Merge changes to the main or master branch via pull requests.
8. Security
8.1 Sanitization
Use Angular’s built-in sanitization to protect against XSS attacks.
Avoid unsafe innerHTML usage.
8.2 Authentication
Use Angular’s route guards to protect routes.
Implement proper session management and token handling.
